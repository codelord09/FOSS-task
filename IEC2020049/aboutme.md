We have always faced a situation where we wondered that if there is a way that this software is available for free? 
FOSS and Open-Source communities have come a long way, and this is very encouraging more and more companies are open sourcing their major projects.
My vision aligns with that of open source communities and promise to continue working in this domain.
I will serve the Open-Source Community and will contribute to elevating the FOSS experience of the consumer to the next level.

I have worked in git,github,c,c++ and HTML.
